# Computational Robotics Lab

The [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/) (CRL) is a research group within the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html). CRL is led by [Prof. Dr. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).

We develop theoretical foundations to shape the way future generations of robots are made, how they operate in complex environments, and how they interact with us. In this quest, we define **Computational Robotics** as the fusion of simulation, algorithms and data. In brief, we formalize advanced simulation models to provide robots with an innate understanding of the laws of physics. Leveraging these models, we devise practical algorithms for motion planning, motion control and computational design problems. Whenever possible, we exploit data to efficiently learn solution spaces, to create faithful digital twins through real-to-sim methodologies, and to enable humans to teach robots new skills.

## CRL GitHub Guideline 

- Invite students or external collaborators as "Outside collaborators"
